# Local Design AI 🎨

A local-first design tool that generates unique, creative web interfaces using AI. Built with modern web technologies and focused on rapid design ideation and experimentation.

This is just a POC, the designs it produces are absolutely terrible. Just wanted to see if I could do this myself.

- 🖼️ Generate complete UI designs from text prompts
- 🎭 Multiple creative design styles (Editorial, Artistic, Brutalist, etc.)
- 🚀 Real-time design generation with progress updates
- 💻 Runs completely local - no cloud dependencies
- 🛠️ Clean, semantic HTML and CSS output
- 📱 Responsive designs by default
